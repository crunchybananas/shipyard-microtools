A component is made up of a template and, optionally, this component\n * object.\n *\n * ## Defining a Component\n *\n * To define a component, subclass `Component` and add your own properties,\n * methods and lifecycle hooks:\n *\n * ```ts\n * import Component from '@glimmer/component';\n *\n * export default class extends Component {\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * ## Lifecycle Hooks\n *\n * Lifecycle hooks allow you to respond to changes to a component, such as when\n * it gets created, rendered, updated or destroyed. To add a lifecycle hook to a\n * component, implement the hook as a method on your component subclass.\n *\n * For example, to be notified when Glimmer has rendered your component so you\n * can attach a legacy jQuery plugin, implement the `didInsertElement()` method:\n *\n * ```ts\n * import Component from '@glimmer/component';\n *\n * export default class extends Component {\n *   didInsertElement() {\n *     $(this.element).pickadate();\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * ## Data for Templates\n *\n * `Component`s have two different kinds of data, or state, that can be\n * displayed in templates:\n *\n * 1. Arguments\n * 2. Properties\n *\n * Arguments are data that is passed in to a component from its parent\n * component. For example, if I have a `UserGreeting` component, I can pass it\n * a name and greeting to use:\n *\n * ```hbs\n * <UserGreeting @name=\"Ricardo\" @greeting=\"Olá\" />\n * ```\n *\n * Inside my `UserGreeting` template, I can access the `@name` and `@greeting`\n * arguments that I've been given:\n *\n * ```hbs\n * {{@greeting}}, {{@name}}!\n * ```\n *\n * Arguments are also available inside my component:\n *\n * ```ts\n * console.log(this.args.greeting); // prints \"Olá\"\n * ```\n *\n * Properties, on the other hand, are internal to the component and declared in\n * the class. You can use properties to store data that you want to show in the\n * template, or pass to another component as an argument.\n *\n * ```ts\n * import Component from '@glimmer/component';\n *\n * export default class extends Component {\n *   user = {\n *     name: 'Robbie'\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * In the above example, we've defined a component with a `user` property that\n * contains an object with its own `name` property.\n *\n * We can render that property in our template:\n *\n * ```hbs\n * Hello, {{user.name}}!\n * ```\n *\n * We can also take that property and pass it as an argument to the\n * `UserGreeting` component we defined above:\n *\n * ```hbs\n * <UserGreeting @greeting=\"Hello\" @name={{user.name}} />\n * ```\n *\n * ## Arguments vs. Properties\n *\n * Remember, arguments are data that was given to your component by its parent\n * component, and properties are data your component has defined for itself.\n *\n * You can tell the difference between arguments and properties in templates\n * because arguments always start with an `@` sign (think \"A is for arguments\"):\n *\n * ```hbs\n * {{@firstName}}\n * ```\n *\n * We know that `@firstName` came from the parent component, not the current\n * component, because it starts with `@` and is therefore an argument.\n *\n * On the other hand, if we see:\n *\n * ```hbs\n * {{name}}\n * ```\n *\n * We know that `name` is a property on the component. If we want to know where\n * the data is coming from, we can go look at our component class to find out.\n *\n * Inside the component itself, arguments always show up inside the component's\n * `args` property. For example, if `{{@firstName}}` is `Tom` in the template,\n * inside the component `this.args.firstName` would also be `Tom`.\n */\nlet GlimmerComponent$1 = class GlimmerComponent {\n  /**\n   * Constructs a new component and assigns itself the passed properties.

For example, someone\n  might make a `button` in the template and handle the click behavior in the\n  JavaScript file that shares the same name as the template.\n\n  Components are broken down into two categories:\n\n  - Components _without_ JavaScript, that are based only on a template. These\n    are called Template-only or TO components.\n  - Components _with_ JavaScript, which consist of a template and a backing\n    class.\n\n  Ember ships with two types of JavaScript classes for components:\n\n  1. Glimmer components, imported from `@glimmer/component`, which are the\n     default components for Ember Octane (3.15) and more recent editions.\n  2. Classic components, imported from `@ember/component`, which were the\n     default for older editions of Ember (pre 3.15).\n\n  Below is the documentation for Template-only and Glimmer components. If you\n  are looking for the API documentation for Classic components, it is\n  [available here](/ember/release/classes/Component). The source code for\n  Glimmer components can be found in [`@glimmer/component`](https://github.com/glimmerjs/glimmer.js/tree/master/packages/%40glimmer/component).\n\n  ## Defining a Template-only Component\n\n  The simplest way to create a component is to create a template file in\n  `app/templates/components`. For example, if you name a template\n  `app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs`:\n\n  ```app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs\n  <h1>{{@person.name}}</h1>\n  <img src={{@person.avatar}}>\n  <p class='signature'>{{@person.signature}}</p>\n  ```\n\n  You will be able to use `<PersonProfile />` to invoke this component elsewhere\n  in your application:\n\n  ```app/templates/application.hbs\n  <PersonProfile @person={{this.currentUser}} />\n  ```\n\n  Note that component names are capitalized here in order to distinguish them\n  from regular HTML elements, but they are dasherized in the file system.\n\n  While the angle bracket invocation form is generally preferred, it is also\n  possible to invoke the same component with the `{{person-profile}}` syntax:\n\n  ```app/templates/application.hbs\n  {{person-profile person=this.currentUser}}\n  ```\n\n  Note that with this syntax, you use dashes in the component name and\n  arguments are passed without the `@` sign.\n\n  In both cases, Ember will render the content of the component template we\n  created above. The end result will be something like this:\n\n  ```html\n  <h1>Tomster</h1>\n  <img src=\"https://emberjs.com/tomster.jpg\">\n  <p class='signature'>Out of office this week</p>\n  ```\n\n  ## File System Nesting\n\n  Components can be nested inside sub-folders for logical groupping. For\n  example, if we placed our template in\n  `app/templates/components/person/short-profile.hbs`, we can invoke it as\n  `<Person::ShortProfile />`:\n\n  ```app/templates/application.hbs\n  <Person::ShortProfile @person={{this.currentUser}} />\n  ```\n\n  Or equivalently, `{{person/short-profile}}`:\n\n  ```app/templates/application.hbs\n  {{person/short-profile person=this.currentUser}}\n  ```\n\n  ## Using Blocks\n\n  You can use `yield` inside a template to include the **contents** of any block\n  attached to the component. For instance, if we added a `{{yield}}` to our\n  component like so:\n\n  ```app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs\n  <h1>{{@person.name}}</h1>\n  {{yield}}\n  ```\n\n  We could then invoke it like this:\n\n  ```handlebars\n  <PersonProfile @person={{this.currentUser}}>\n    <p>Admin mode</p>\n  </PersonProfile>\n  ```\n\n  or with curly syntax like this:\n\n  ```handlebars\n  {{#person-profile person=this.currentUser}}\n    <p>Admin mode</p>\n  {{/person-profile}}\n  ```\n\n  And the content passed in between the brackets of the component would be\n  rendered in the same place as the `{{yield}}` within it, replacing it.\n\n  Blocks are executed in their original context, meaning they have access to the\n  scope and any in-scope variables where they were defined.\n\n  ### Passing parameters to blocks\n\n  You can also pass positional parameters to `{{yield}}`, which are then made\n  available in the block:\n\n  ```app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs\n  <h1>{{@person.name}}</h1>\n  {{yield @person.signature}}\n  ```\n\n  We can then use this value in the block like so:\n\n  ```handlebars\n  <PersonProfile @person={{this.currentUser}} as |signature|>\n    {{signature}}\n  </PersonProfile>\n  ```\n\n  ### Passing multiple blocks\n\n  You can pass multiple blocks to a component by giving them names, and\n  specifying which block you are yielding to with `{{yield}}`. For instance, if\n  we wanted to add a way for users to customize the title of our\n  `<PersonProfile>` component, we could add a named block inside of the header:\n\n  ```app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs\n  <h1>{{yield to=\"title\"}}</h1>\n  {{yield}}\n  ```\n\n  This component could then be invoked like so:\n\n  ```handlebars\n  <PersonProfile @person={{this.currentUser}}>\n    <:title>{{this.currentUser.name}}</:title>\n    <:default>{{this.currentUser.signature}}</:default>\n  </PersonProfile>\n  ```\n\n  When passing named blocks, you must name every block, including the `default`\n  block, which is the block that is defined if you do not pass a `to` parameter\n  to `{{yield}}`. Whenever you invoke a component without passing explicitly\n  named blocks, the passed block is considered the `default` block.\n\n  ### Passing parameters to named blocks\n\n  You can also pass parameters to named blocks:\n\n  ```app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs\n  <h1>{{yield @person.name to=\"title\"}}</h1>\n  {{yield @person.signature}}\n  ```\n\n  These parameters can then be used like so:\n\n  ```handlebars\n  <PersonProfile @person={{this.currentUser}}>\n    <:title as |name|>{{name}}</:title>\n    <:default as |signature|>{{signature}}</:default>\n  </PersonProfile>\n  ```\n\n  ### Checking to see if a block exists\n\n  You can also check to see if a block exists using the `(has-block)` keyword,\n  and conditionally use it, or provide a default template instead.\n\n  ```app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs\n  <h1>\n    {{#if (has-block \"title\")}}\n      {{yield @person.name to=\"title\"}}\n    {{else}}\n      {{@person.name}}\n    {{/if}}\n  </h1>\n\n  {{#if (has-block)}}\n    {{yield @person.signature}}\n  {{else}}\n    {{@person.signature}}\n  {{/if}}\n  ```\n\n  With this template, we can then optionally pass in one block, both blocks, or\n  none at all:\n\n  ```handlebars\n  {{! passing both blocks }}\n  <PersonProfile @person={{this.currentUser}}>\n    <:title as |name|>{{name}}</:title>\n    <:default as |signature|>{{signature}}</:default>\n  </PersonProfile>\n\n  {{! passing just the title block }}\n  <PersonProfile @person={{this.currentUser}}>\n    <:title as |name|>{{name}}</:title>\n  </PersonProfile>\n\n  {{! passing just the default block }}\n  <PersonProfile @person={{this.currentUser}} as |signature|>\n    {{signature}}\n  </PersonProfile>\n\n  {{! not passing any blocks }}\n  <PersonProfile @person={{this.currentUser}}/>\n  ```\n\n  ### Checking to see if a block has parameters\n\n  We can also check if a block receives parameters using the `(has-block-params)`\n  keyword, and conditionally yield different values if so.\n\n  ```app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs\n  {{#if (has-block-params)}}\n    {{yield @person.signature}}\n  {{else}}\n    {{yield}}\n  {{/if}}\n  ```\n\n  ## Customizing Components With JavaScript\n\n  To add JavaScript to a component, create a JavaScript file in the same\n  location as the template file, with the same name, and export a subclass\n  of `Component` as the default value. For example, to add Javascript to the\n  `PersonProfile` component which we defined above, we would create\n  `app/components/person-profile.js` and export our class as the default, like\n  so:\n\n  ```app/components/person-profile.js\n  import Component from '@glimmer/component';\n\n  export default class PersonProfileComponent extends Component {\n    get displayName() {\n      let { title, firstName, lastName } = this.args.person;\n\n      if (title) {\n        return `${title} ${lastName}`;\n      } else {\n        return `${firstName} ${lastName}`;\n      }\n    })\n  }\n  ```\n\n  You can add your own properties, methods, and lifecycle hooks to this\n  subclass to customize its behavior, and you can reference the instance of the\n  class in your template using `{{this}}`. For instance, we could access the\n  `displayName` property of our `PersonProfile` component instance in the\n  template like this:\n\n  ```app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs\n  <h1>{{this.displayName}}</h1>\n  {{yield}}\n  ```\n\n  ## `constructor`\n\n  params: `owner` object and `args` object\n\n  Constructs a new component and assigns itself the passed properties. The\n  constructor is run whenever a new instance of the component is created, and\n  can be used to setup the initial state of the component.\n\n  ```javascript\n  import Component from '@glimmer/component';\n\n  export default class SomeComponent extends Component {\n    constructor(owner, args) {\n      super(owner, args);\n\n      if (this.args.displayMode === 'list') {\n        this.items = [];\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Service injections and arguments are available in the constructor.\n\n  ```javascript\n  import Component from '@glimmer/component';\n  import { service } from '@ember/service';\n\n  export default class SomeComponent extends Component {\n    @service myAnimations;\n\n    constructor(owner, args) {\n      super(owner, args);\n\n      if (this.args.fadeIn === true) {\n        this.myAnimations.register(this, 'fade-in');\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  ## `willDestroy`\n\n  `willDestroy` is called after the component has been removed from the DOM, but\n  before the component is fully destroyed. This lifecycle hook can be used to\n  cleanup the component and any related state.\n\n  ```javascript\n  import Component from '@glimmer/component';\n  import { service } from '@ember/service';\n\n  export default class SomeComponent extends Component {\n    @service myAnimations;\n\n    willDestroy() {\n      super.willDestroy(...arguments);\n\n      this.myAnimations.unregister(this);\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  ## `args`\n\n  The `args` property of Glimmer components is an object that contains the\n  _arguments_ that are passed to the component. For instance, the\n  following component usage:\n\n  ```handlebars\n  <SomeComponent @fadeIn={{true}} />\n  ```\n\n  Would result in the following `args` object to be passed to the component:\n\n  ```javascript\n  { fadeIn: true }\n  ```\n\n  `args` can be accessed at any point in the component lifecycle, including\n  `constructor` and `willDestroy`. They are also automatically marked as tracked\n  properties, and they can be depended on as computed property dependencies:\n\n  ```javascript\n  import Component from '@glimmer/component';\n  import { computed } from '@ember/object';\n\n  export default class SomeComponent extends Component {\n\n    @computed('args.someValue')\n    get computedGetter() {\n      // updates whenever args.someValue updates\n      return this.args.someValue;\n    }\n\n    get standardGetter() {\n      // updates whenever args.anotherValue updates (Ember 3.13+)\n      return this.args.anotherValue;\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  ## `isDestroying`\n\n  A boolean flag to tell if the component is in the process of destroying. This is set to\n  true before `willDestroy` is called.\n\n  ## `isDestroyed`\n  A boolean to tell if the component has been fully destroyed. This is set to true\n  after `willDestroy` is called.\n\n  @module @glimmer/component\n  @public\n*/\nclass GlimmerComponent extends GlimmerComponent$1 {\n  constructor(owner, args) {\n    super(owner, args);\n    if (true && !(owner !== null && typeof owner === 'object')) {\n      throw new Error(`You must pass both the owner and args to super() in your component: ${this.constructor.name}.
